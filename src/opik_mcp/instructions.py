"""``InitializeResult.instructions`` content (ADR 0004 D6).

This blob is delivered once per MCP session on the ``initialize`` handshake
and injected as system-prompt-like context by supported hosts (Claude Code,
Cursor, VS Code, Goose). Hosts that ignore the field lose nothing — each
tool's description is self-contained, so this is purely additive.

The content sets cross-cutting context (workspace, Opik URL, today's date)
and primes the LLM on when to prefer ``read``/``list``/direct writes vs.
``ask_ollie``. Per GitHub MCP's published data, dynamic per-session
instructions are worth +25pp workflow adherence on capable models and
+60pp on smaller ones, so this is the highest-leverage single dial we
have on tool selection quality.

The blob is rendered per session (see ``server.install_session_instructions``):
``workspace`` prefers the OAuth-authorized workspace for THIS session — the
inbound ``Comet-Workspace`` header, else the name introspected from the bearer
(``resolved_workspace_name``) — and only falls back to the static ``Settings``
workspace for stdio / API-key installs. ``opik_url`` is the Opik **UI** base,
derived from ``Settings`` (the REST ``OPIK_URL`` minus its ``/api`` suffix).

{default_project_clause}
Tool selection:
- read / list: use for any "show me X" or "what is Y" — these are the cheapest \
reads. read takes (entity_type, id_or_name_or_uri); list takes (entity_type, \
optional name filter, page, size). Readable entity types include trace, span, \
project, experiment, prompt, test_suite, thread. Composite reads (trace, prompt, \
thread) inline their child collections so one call usually gets the full picture. \
For a thread, pass the thread link/URI or a project_id — read('thread', …) \
returns the messages list, and list('thread', project_id=…) enumerates a \
project's threads. get_thread_transcript retrieves and caches all traces in a \
LangChain thread, returning only a compact text transcript.
- Direct writes — use when the user's intent is concrete and well-defined \
("score this trace 0.8 on helpfulness", "comment 'retry with temperature=0' \
on span X"). Skip ask_ollie for these — narrower tools are faster and more \
deterministic. The full write surface is two tools: write (takes \
operation + data; pass a list for batch) and schema (returns an op's JSON \
Schema + bundled example). Operations covered by Phase 1: \
{write_operations}. run_experiment is a separate tool. Always consult \
tools/list for what's actually advertised on this connection.
- ask_ollie: use for investigative questions ("why is X failing?"), cross-entity \
synthesis ("compare experiments A and B"), or when authoring / instrumentation \
requires Opik domain expertise. Returns a thread_id you can pass back for \
follow-ups. Writes Ollie performs mid-stream (scores, comments, test-suite \
items, prompts) execute without a per-action confirmation step — be \
intentional about what you ask for.

Today's date is {date}.\
