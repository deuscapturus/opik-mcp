"""Conformance — the exact-tool-surface rule.

`tools/list` is part of the public MCP contract. Adding a tool is a
major-version change (every host caches the list); removing one breaks
any agent that has a prompt pinned to it. We pin the set here so an
accidental `@mcp.tool` either ships intentionally with a snapshot
update, or fails CI.
